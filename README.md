# Cipher Master
 An iOS app that encodes and decodes text using ciphers.
 
This was the final project for my CSC 399 class, iOS App Programming, at the University of Mount Union taught by Dr. James Klayder. I do not have a Mac, so there is not much testing I can do on this app anymore.

This app contains the following sections:
- A page that gives the history, an explanation, and an example of various ciphers
- A game that allows the user to practice encoding and decoding various ciphers
- A page that allows the user to encode or decode text using the cipher of their choice

The following ciphers are implemented:
- [Caesar Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)
- [Rail Fence Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_fence_cipher)
- [Simple Substitution Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher#Simple_substitution)
